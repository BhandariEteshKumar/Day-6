alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
alert(`Wor
 ld`)
alert(3 +
1
+ 2); // this is multiple line code and its working

Explanation :

When the html is rendered the script.js file is invoked. In the script.js
first alert("I'm JavaScript") is poped, likewise all the alert are poped
in the order wise. The alert('Wor ld') has template literal so the ld is 
printed in the next line. In last alert everything is added as all are 
numbers.
